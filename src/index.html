          Let us show you the hidden gems and adventurous trails our place has
          to offer. Our mountains are much less explored than their Slovakian,
          Polish or even Romanian counterparts. Add to that maps in Cyrillic and
          barely marked routes, and you are up for a true adventure!

          <h3>Tranquility cracks</h3>
          <p>
            We go on a visually stimulating adventure through some of most
            scenic and popular ravines. The incredibly impressive Tranquility
            Cracks shows off a complex series of paths, tunnel ways and
            awe-inspiring views.

            Making our way through Skeleton Gorge's ravine, along the Smuts
            Track. Navigating through a series of ladders and mossy river
            boulders, we arrive at one of the famous and historical white beach
            sand dams atop the summit.

            We commence at the base of the Tafelberg start point walking the
            contour. With unique views and possibly the best vantage point to
            make out the entire Lion, lying below Table Mountain.
